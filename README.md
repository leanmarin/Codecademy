# Codecademy

Welcome to the Codecademy exercise repository! This repository contains all the exercises that I have completed during my journey in Codecademy. You will find the code and some brief explanations of what I have learned. The exercises are organized by topic, making it easy for you to find what you are looking for. Feel free to use this repository as a resource for your own learning or as a source of inspiration for your own projects.

The repository will be updated as I progress through the course, so check back often to see what I've learned. If you have any questions or feedback, feel free to open an issue or contact me. I'm looking forward to sharing my journey with you!

Happy Learning!
